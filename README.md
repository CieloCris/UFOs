# UFOs sighting Analysis

In this challenge, our client Dana gave us the task of building a webpage about UFOs sightings with a table capable of filtering data. Our final **purpose** was to create a webpage that has a dynamic table with filters based on various criteria, such as date, city, and shape.

Our **resources** and tools to achieve our goal were JavaScript, Visual Studio Code, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

## Results

The following screenshot presents our UFOs Sightings webpage, which contains several elements, including a table and data filters.

The image below shows a close-up of the dynamic table and its filters by date, city, state, country, and shape.

In the last screenshots, we show how the filters appear after being used. In other words, we demonstrate how the filters work.

## Summary

Although the webpage looks awesome, it has some drawbacks. For example, you can only search for information in lower-cased letters ( if we search for "La Mesa" instead of "la mesa", the filter will not show the user any results). We can conclude that this characteristic affects the user experience. Also, searching by dates is complicated, since the user would have to know the specific dates of when the incidents occurred. 

## Recommendations:

- Create a filter that includes the duration of UFO sightings, this can be achieved by time grouping.
- Create a function to sort the results data. For example, cities could be sorted from A to Z and vice-versa, while dates could be sorted ascending and descending.
- Find a way for filters to recognize upper-case and lower-case letters to improve the user experience.
